# GitHubCloneProject

## Objective
This project is designed to practice common Git and GitHub workflows, including creating branches, making changes in separate branches, and resolving merge conflicts. The steps in this project simulate a collaborative scenario where multiple branches may have changes that need to be merged.

## Steps Covered
1. Created a feature branch (`feature-greeting`) to develop a new feature.
2. Made changes in both the main branch and feature branch.
3. Merged the feature branch into the main branch, handling any merge conflicts.
4. Pushed all changes to GitHub to complete the simulated workflow.
